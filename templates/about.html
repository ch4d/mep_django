                There are MESA chapters all over the country but ours is unique. The MESA Engineering Program 
                <abbr title="attribute">(MEP)</abbr> is an organization assembled of alumni, professors, students, 
                mentors, and parents.

                Half of the students in the country who select engineering or computer science majors are no longer in these majors after their first science course. This is not because they are not capable or well prepared. It is because they started a long and complicated journey without a road map or guide. MEP can be your roadmap to success.
                CSUS MEP is recognized as one of the top programs in the nation. Students who get involved with MEP during their senior year are among the most prepared coming to the university. You will get guidance from one of the top programs in the country in terms of recruitment, retention and graduation rates.

                MESA was formed in the 60's by a group of concerened Berkeley educators which launched a study as to why there were so few African Americans, Latinos, and American Indians were enrolled in UC Berkeleys College of Engineering. They developed a solution based on pre-college intervention. In 1970 the MESA program was founded at Oakland Technical High School with 25 students. In 1973, concerned with about issues of retention, CSU-Northridge engineering faculty member Ray Landis establishes the Minority Engineering Program and today has been renamed to the MESA Engineering Program.
